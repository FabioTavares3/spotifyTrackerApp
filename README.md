# spotifyTrackerApp
This app is going to be an statistical application model to keep track of my spotify stats like track listening counts, time listened, etc.
The reason for me to do that is because, the ones I use are either incomplete or simply aren't convinient enough. For me to see my full stats, most of the times if there is this option, I got to pay a fee, and i surely don't want to do that already paying spotify premium. 
It's also an university project requested by the professor.
